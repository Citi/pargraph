**Pargraph is a lightweight parallel graph computation library for Python**. At its core, Pargraph consists of two
modules: a graph creation tool and an embedded graph scheduler. You can use either or both modules in your code.

## Installation

### Install Pargraph via pip

```bash
pip install pargraph
```

If you want to use GraphBLAS for better graph scheduling performance, you may install the optional `graphblas` extra:

```bash
pip install pargraph[graphblas]
```

## Graph creation

Pargraph provides a simple graph creation tool that allows you to build task graphs by decorating Python functions.

There are two decorators:
- `@delayed`: Decorate a function to make it delayed. Cannot contain function calls decorated with `@delayed` or `@graph`.
- `@graph`: Decorate a function to make it a graph. May contain function calls decorated with `@delayed` or `@graph`.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np
from pargraph import graph, delayed


@delayed
def filter_array(array: np.ndarray, low: float, high: float) -> np.ndarray:
    return array[(array >= low) & (array <= high)]


@delayed
def sort_array(array: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    return np.sort(array)


@delayed
def reduce_arrays(*arrays: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    return np.concatenate(arrays)


@graph
def map_reduce_sort(array: np.ndarray, partition_count: int) -> np.ndarray:
    return reduce_arrays(
        *(
            sort_array(filter_array(array, i / partition_count, (i + 1) / partition_count))
            for i in range(partition_count)
        )
    )
```

The `map_reduce_sort` function behaves like a normal Python function if called with concrete arguments.

```python
import numpy as np

map_reduce_sort(np.random.rand(20))

# [0.06253707 0.06795382 0.11492823 0.14512393 0.20183152 0.41109117
#  0.42613798 0.45156214 0.4714821  0.54000373 0.54902451 0.62671881
#  0.64402013 0.65147012 0.70903525 0.77846584 0.83861765 0.89170381
#  0.92492478 0.95370363]
```

Use the `to_graph` method to generate a graph representation of the function.

```python
map_reduce_sort.to_graph(partition_count=4).to_dot().write_png("map_reduce_sort.png")
```

![Map-Reduce Sort](docs/_static/map_reduce_sort.png)

Moreover, you can compose graph functions with other graph functions to generate ever more complex graphs.

```python
@graph
def map_reduce_sort_recursive(
    array: np.ndarray, partition_counts: List[int], _low: float = 0, _high: float = 1
) -> np.ndarray:
    if len(partition_counts) == 0:
        return sort_array(array)

    partition_count, *partition_counts = partition_counts

    sorted_partitions = []
    for i in range(partition_count):
        low = _low + (_high - _low) * (i / partition_count)
        high = _low + (_high - _low) * ((i + 1) / partition_count)
        sorted_partitions.append(map_reduce_sort_recursive(filter_array(array, low, high), partition_counts, low, high))

    return reduce_arrays(*sorted_partitions)
```

```python
map_reduce_sort_recursive.to_graph(partition_counts=4).to_dot().write_png("map_reduce_sort_recursive.png")
```

![Map-Reduce Sort Recursive](docs/_static/map_reduce_sort_recursive.png)

Use the `to_dict` method to convert the generated graph to a dict graph.

```python
import numpy as np
from distributed import Client

with Client() as client:
    client.get(map_reduce_sort.to_graph(partition_count=4).to_dict(array=np.random.rand(20)))[0]

# [0.06253707 0.06795382 0.11492823 0.14512393 0.20183152 0.41109117
#  0.42613798 0.45156214 0.4714821  0.54000373 0.54902451 0.62671881
#  0.64402013 0.65147012 0.70903525 0.77846584 0.83861765 0.89170381
#  0.92492478 0.95370363]
```

## Graph scheduler

Pargraph brings graph parallelization to parallel backends that may not support it out of the box. Think of it as a mini
graph scheduler that lives in your program/application and sends out tasks concurrently to a parallel backend of your
choice.

It implements Dask's `get` API and supports the same task graph format used by Dask making it a drop-in Dask replacement
for applications that don't need a fully-fledged graph scheduler.

If installed, graph scheduling is powered by [GraphBLAS](https://graphblas.org), a high-performance sparse matrix linear
algebra library. It allows better scheduling performance for large and complex graphs (e.g. graphs with 100k+ nodes)
compared to native Python implementations.

## Usage

### Initialize graph engine

```python
from pargraph import GraphEngine

graph_engine = GraphEngine()
```

### Choose a parallel backend

If you want to use a parallel backend other than the default local multiprocessing backend, you may initialize a
different parallel backend and pass it into `GraphEngine`'s constructor.

#### Example with a dask backend

```python
from distributed import Client
from distributed.cfexecutor import ClientExecutor

dask_client = Client(...)
graph_engine = GraphEngine(ClientExecutor(dask_client))
```

You may also implement your own parallel backend by implementing the `submit` method.

#### Example with a custom backend

```python
from concurrent.futures import Future


class CustomBackend:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def submit(self, fn, /, *args, **kwargs) -> Future:
        future = Future()
        future.set_result(fn(*args, **kwargs))
        return future


backend = CustomBackend()
graph_engine = GraphEngine(backend)
```

### Compute graph

Build the task graph and compute a key of your choice:

```python
def inc(i):
    return i + 1


def add(a, b):
    return a + b


graph = {
    "x": 1,
    "y": (inc, "x"),
    "z": (add, "y", 10)
}
graph_engine.get(graph, "z")  # 12
```

You may also compute multiple keys if you like:

```python
graph_engine.get(graph, ["x", "y", "z"])  # [1, 2, 10]
```
